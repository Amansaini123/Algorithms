// Remember relax all edges v-1 times


// It first calculates the shortest distances which have at-most one edge in the path. 
// Then, it calculates the shortest paths with at-most 2 edges, and so on. After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, 
// the shortest paths with at most i edges are calculated. There can be maximum |V| – 1 edges in any simple path, that is why the outer loop runs |v| – 1 times. 
// The idea is, assuming that there is no negative weight cycle, if we have calculated shortest paths with at most i edges, then an iteration over all edges 
// guarantees to give shortest path with at-most (i+1) edges 

// In directed weighted graph find shortest path to all other vertex
// as in undirected graph weight weight edge when converted to directed graph forms a negative cycle 
// Follows Dynamic programming strategy
// The idea here is that Relax all the edges v-1 times i.e from src vertex even if the longest distance is off all nodes then also the distance is v-1
// i.e maximum there can be v-1 edges between two nodes so it will cover all possible path if we relax nodes v-1 times
// Complexity is 0(v*e) whereas for dijkstra it is v*log(v+e)
